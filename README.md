**[Hi, I’m Amanda!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-ngo-679b89230/)**

This is my GitHub profile, home to a plethora of class work, reference code, and personal projects of mine. I'm always open to learning and improving, so there's a lot of room to grow. Hopefully, I'll get to add more work here soon!

Thank you for reading!
